    <p>Dear Reader,<br>I’m a Product Manager and Personal Trainer by trade. I use product roadmaps in my day-job to define and execute a product vision. As a trainer, I help my clients create a roadmap for their lives. <br><br>What I love about Product Management is the cross-functional process of figuring out what’s important. In my view, the variables of stakeholder requirements, strategic goals and technical capabilities can only be balanced through the application of principles. Just like in life, when you decide on a set of principles, you create a North Star that will allow you to keep moving. This allows for ruthless prioritisation in your day-to-day activities, keeping you on track with your purpose. <br><br>As such, my work principles are nested in my life principles: Curiosity, Respect and Truth. I believe that we should always be striving to learn something new each day. This involves listening and reaching out to those you meet, as everybody is an expert in something, be it your software development, marketing, admin colleagues - or your wise old hairdresser. <br><br>Truth means order; it means being honest with your competencies. I believe that we can only access our fullest intuitive capabilities when we are living our truth. As a Product Manager, truth means accountability; it means that your decision making process is water-tight, that your prioritisation has an entirely justifiable explanation using data, logic and common sense.<br><br>These principles have allowed me to thrive in teams from the most innovative companies. I was involved in the market entry of Tesla Energy into the UK, providing feature requirements for their Powerwall app that is revolutionising the way we consume energy at home. As a Product Consultant at ERM, I advised the European Commission on the environmental and social impacts of breakthrough double-sided solar voltaic products. Both projects demanded a level of cross-functional team cohesion never seen in both companies before, to produce results that measurably pushed the renewables industry forward.<br><br>Over the last year in FinTech I have been learning from conversations with key players of the European financial sector. These include prospects, thought leaders and new clients from asset management, central banks and boutique investment firms. Building these relationships helped to validate product feature priorities whilst driving awareness, trust and subsequent adoption of Urgentem’s Element6™ Climate Risk Platform. Together, we successfully reduced the climate-related risk by 20% of client portfolios totalling £600 million in AUM; a significant sum of funds in just one year divested from unsustainable ventures. Such is the power of B2B SaaS… <br><br>Furthermore, my fitness clients help me to be more accountable to myself and push me to practice what I preach. It means I’m motivated to bring my best to my team at work and to constantly seek constructive feedback and strive for improvement. This approach is providing the resilience required in my current projects, which includes innovating the geospatial intelligence portfolio at Ordnance Survey; Britain&#x27;s mapping agency.<br><br>Above all, I enjoy working with passionate teams who try to make the mundane exciting. This has coloured my 3 years of experience leading product architecture, infrastructure and UX design and advisory.  <br><br>If this sounds like someone you’d like to partner with, I’d love to hear from you. Either way, thank you for reading this far. <br><br>Yours sincerely, <br><br>Ramin Hoodeh<br>‍</p>
